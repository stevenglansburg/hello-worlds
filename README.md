# hello-worlds
I don't really know what I'm doing right now. 
Just kind of fooling around with coding. 26 years old. 
Been working in kitchens since 18 and I want out. 
Recently did one semester of school and now taking a semester off because my wife and I just bought a house. 
Hopefully I can teach myself some stuff before I go back to school.
